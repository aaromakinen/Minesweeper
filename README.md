# Minesweeper
Does not represent current C-coding skills.
The implementation of the game was done as simple as possible since the time limit was quite 
harsh and my knowledge of C language was quite narrow at the time. Hence, there is no utilization of a 
dynamic memory allocation or even pointers.
